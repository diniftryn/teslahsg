### Project Background

The Industry Project (IP) is regarding the development of a mini web-based ERP system for a hypothetical company that our group has come up with, called 'TeslahSG Pte Ltd'.

TeslahSG Pte Ltd is an evolving SME selling electric vehicles (EVs) with operations in Singapore, China and Vietnam and based in Singapore. The company has recently realized the need to have their aged work processes automated and made more efficient. At present, its office workers deal largely with manual processes; from user/staff management (HR), asset management (IT), company product inventory management (Logistics), to invoicing and billing (Pricing). The company needs to overhaul these work processes by implementing an overall system to automate and manage the current processes. Thus, the proposed solution is to develop a new integrated work process system online.

Therefore, our group has developed this webapp as an online work process system (ERP) to replace and integrate manual work processes using 3-tier architecture:
- Presentation tier / Front End: Developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Application tier / Middle End: Server-side Scripting using PHP
- Data tier / Back End: Database using MySQL
We also developed the Authentication and Security for the ERP system with a login/password, use of error handlers and Session Management, as well as the documentation of Project Development, Support and Maintenance for the ERP system.
